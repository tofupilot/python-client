"""Deprecated compatibility wrapper around the `upload` output callback.

The original `TofuPilot` context manager uploaded the run *and* streamed the
live test state over MQTT to the legacy operator UI. The streaming backend is
decommissioned (the server responds "streaming not configured"), and the
TofuPilot CLI (`tofupilot run`) provides the live operator UI now. This
wrapper keeps `with TofuPilot(test):` working for existing bench scripts:
it registers the `upload` callback and preserves the old quiet Ctrl-C exit,
nothing more.

    """
    Deprecated context manager that uploads the OpenHTF test to TofuPilot on
    completion. Prefer registering the callback directly:

    ```python
    from tofupilot.openhtf import upload

    test.add_output_callbacks(upload())
    test.execute(lambda: "SN15")
    ```

    For a live operator UI, run the unmodified test file with the CLI:
    `tofupilot run`.

    Behavioral notes for scripts migrating off this wrapper:
    - `stream` is accepted but ignored — the legacy MQTT operator UI it fed
      no longer exists on the server.
    - The wrapper suppresses `KeyboardInterrupt` on exit (quiet Ctrl-C), as
      it always did. The plain callback does not.
