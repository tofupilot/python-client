"""TofuPilot integration with OpenHTF.

`upload()` is an OpenHTF output callback: register it with
`test.add_output_callbacks(upload())` and the run is sent to TofuPilot when
the test finishes.

`TofuPilot` is a deprecated context manager kept for existing bench scripts;
it wraps that same callback and warns on use. The MQTT streaming it used to
provide is gone — the TofuPilot CLI (`tofupilot run`) is the live operator
UI now.
